### Steganalysis of OpenStego


[OpenStego](https://www.openstego.com/) is a Java tool for hiding information in the spatial domain (steganography and watermarking). At the moment of writing these lines the last version available is v0.7.3.

First we download a copy of the Lena image, then we prepare a file with some secret data and finally we hide the message.

With a simple experiment we can see that the method used for embedding is LSB replacement. That is, we hide the bits of the message by replacing the least significant bit (LSB) of the pixel. Actually, the tool supports using several pixels per channel, but this is even more detectable.


```bash
$ wget http://daniellerch.me/images/lena.png
$ head -500 /dev/urandom | tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 > secret.txt
$ openstego embed -mf secret.txt -cf lena.png -sf stego.png
```

With Aletheia we can check the modifications performed by OpenStego in the stego image:


```bash
$ ./aletheia.py print-diffs lena.png stego.png

Channel 1:
[(226, 227, 1), (223, 222, -1), (221, 220, -1), (223, 222, -1)]
[(229, 228, -1), (234, 235, 1), (174, 175, 1), (180, 181, 1)]
[(190, 191, 1), (204, 205, 1), (202, 203, 1), (204, 205, 1)]
[(210, 211, 1), (208, 209, 1), (207, 206, -1), (204, 205, 1)]
...


Channel 2:

...

Channel 3:

As you can see in the results, when a pixel of the cover image is even the performed operation is +1 and when a pixel of the cover image is odd the performed operation is -1. This is what happens when the embedding operation is LSB replacement. This anomaly has been exploited by several attacks [[1, 2, 3](/doc/REFERENCES.md)].

Let's try a RS attack:

```bash
$ ./aletheia.py rs stego.png 
Hiden data found in channel R 0.25
Hiden data found in channel G 0.24
Hiden data found in channel B 0.27
```

Let's try now with less data:

```bash
$ head -100 /dev/urandom | tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 > secret.txt
$ openstego embed -mf secret.txt -cf lena.png -sf stego.png
$ ./aletheia.py rs stego.png 
Hiden data found in channel R 0.06
Hiden data found in channel G 0.06
Hiden data found in channel B 0.07
```

Obviously, with the original Lena image, the tool does not detect any hidden data:

```bash
$ ./aletheia.py rs lena.png 
No hidden data found
```
