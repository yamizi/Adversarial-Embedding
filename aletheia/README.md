# Aletheia


Aletheia is an open source image steganalysis tool for the detection of hidden messages in images. To achieve its objectives, Aletheia uses state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. It is capable of detecting several different steganographic methods as for example LSB replacement, LSB matching and some kind of adaptive schemes.
